# Pixelation Tool（Picture to Pixels）（图片转像素墙）

This software is designed to transform images into a pixelated grid view, making it easy for users to create pixel art or design structures like pixel walls. It's especially useful for individuals who want to replicate images using a grid-based medium, such as wall art, mosaic tiles, or game design. Below is an overview of the tool and its functionality.
